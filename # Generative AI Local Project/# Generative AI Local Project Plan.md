# Generative AI Local Project Plan

## Notes
- User wants to run generative AI models locally.
- User is unsure about the best interface and models to use.
- User wants to generate images with pixel and color constraints.
- Later, user wants to transition from one provided image to another (image-to-image), using tiled processing for higher resolution.
- User is using MacOS (M1 Max), willing to use significant local resources.
- Prefers offline operation but occasional online access is acceptable.
- Browser-based GUI is preferred, but initial version can be without GUI.
- Speed is not important; quality and capability are prioritized.

## Task List
- [x] Clarify user requirements (use cases, hardware, privacy, etc.)
- [ ] Research suitable local generative AI models (e.g., LLMs, image models)
- [ ] Research user-friendly local interfaces (GUIs, CLIs, APIs)
- [ ] Recommend a shortlist of models and interfaces
- [ ] Plan installation and setup steps

## Current Goal
Research suitable local image generation models
